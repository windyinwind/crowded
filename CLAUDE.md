This is a web application that displays real-time train congestion status using LLM technology.

The backend uses Llama to analyze images from inside train carriages and determine crowd levels.

Platform displays show the status of incoming trains, enabling passengers to identify less crowded carriages and make informed boarding decisions.


The application features two screens:
1. Carriage Status Screen: Displays the current carriage number, congestion status (full / moderate / few people / empty), and capacity percentage (e.g., 150%, 100%, 50%). This screen is mounted at the carriage gate where passengers board.
2. Live Feed Screen: Shows a real-time video stream from inside the carriage.
